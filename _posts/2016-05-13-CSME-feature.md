The paper *Characteristics of undulatory locomotion in granular media* is featured in the CSME[^footnote] Bulletin research highlights. In this paper, we developed a mathematical model to investigate the swimming characteristics of a sandfish lizard ([*Scincus scincus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scincus_scincus)) in granular media.


>Ultimately their research helps to understand how we can design biomimetic
robots capable of efficient and precisely controlled motion through challenging environments,
such as sand.
