title: Paper featured in CSME Bulletin
---

The paper *Characteristics of undulatory locomotion in granular media* is featured in the CSME (The Canadian Society for Mechanical Engineering) Bulletin as a research highlight. In this paper, we employed a mathematical model to investigate the swimming characteristics of a sandfish lizard in a granular media.


>Ultimately their research helps to understand how we can design biomimetic
robots capable of efficient and precisely controlled motion through challenging environments,
such as sand.
