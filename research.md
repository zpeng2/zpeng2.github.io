## I. Active suspensions
Active suspensions are ubiquitous in nature, such as a bath of motile bacteria. Different from a passive suspension, an active suspension consists of particles that are able to self-propel. Experiments have shown that these active matter systems exhibit peculiar behaviors including spontaneous flows, collective motion and enhanced tracer diffusion. Using Brownian dynamics simulations and continuum mechanics, I investigate the transport and rheology of active suspensions.

## II. Bio-locomotion in fluids
Many living organisms, such as flagellated bacteria, swim in a fluid environment by actuating their body appendages.

I study biological locomotion in fluids at low Reynolds number such as the swimming and propulsion of sperm and bacterial flagella. In particular, my current research involves investigating the swimming behavior of flexible filaments as a result of fluid-structure interaction.
