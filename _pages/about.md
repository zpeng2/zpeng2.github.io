I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering](https://www.ualberta.ca/engineering/chemical-materials-engineering/index.html) at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html). Research in the Peng group focuses on the development of theoretical machinery and high-performance (e.g., CUDA-enabled) computational libraries to study the mechanics of soft and [active matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_matter). The key aim is to bridge the gap between micromechanics of constitutive particles and macroscopic phenomena. 

Before joining UAlberta, I was a postdoctoral fellow in the Chemical Physics Theory Group at the University of Toronto. I earned my Ph.D. degree in Chemical Engineering from [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu/) under the supervision of [John Brady](https://cce.caltech.edu/people/john-f-brady). Prior to Caltech, I worked with [Gwynn Elfring](https://soft.mech.ubc.ca/) at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/).

Leveraging the tools of fluid mechanics, nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, applied mathematics, and high-performance computing, we aim to advance our theoretical understanding of the dynamics of soft matter systems. Current research topics include transport, microrheology, fluctuations, and collective motion of colloidal (active) matter. 

If you are interested in joining our research group, whether as a graduate student, an undergraduate researcher, a visiting scholar, or as a postdoctoral fellow, please contact Dr. Peng. If you are interested in collaborating with us, please contact Dr. Peng.
