## Mechanics of active matter

- Positions: Ph.D., M.S., and undergraduate internships
- Start date: Jan 2025 or after
- Location: University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada
- Supervisor: Dr. Zhiwei Peng 
- Method of inquiry: Theory and computation

TL;DR: Fill out this [form](https://forms.gle/wfAvGcViQLaTwurJ6).


We seek motivated students to join the Peng Group in the Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering at the University of Alberta. We develop theoretical machinery and high-performance (CUDA-enabled) computational libraries to study the mechanics of soft and active matter. Topics of interest include transport, microrheology, fluctuations, and collective motion of soft and active matter. Candidates with a strong background and interest in Fluid Mechanics, Thermodynamics, Statistical Mechanics, GPU computing, and/or Applied Mathematics are particularly encouraged to apply.

Active matter is a novel and exciting class of materials that include suspensions of motile bacteria, molecular motors, and synthetic self-propelled colloids. Potential applications of active matter include catalysis, chemical sensing, self-assembling intelligent materials, and targeted drug delivery.  Interested candidates are encouraged to look through the attached references to gauge their interest in the field and fit for the position.

If you would like to join as a graduate student or undergraduate intern, please fill out this [inquiry form](https://forms.gle/wfAvGcViQLaTwurJ6). **Direct email messages to Dr. Peng will not be considered.**

For inquiries regarding **postdoctoral** positions, please email Dr. Peng and include your CV.
