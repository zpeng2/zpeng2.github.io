title: Studying the swimming motion of sandfish and flagella at UBC
---

I did my master at University of British Columbia in the beautiful city of Vancouver and graduated in May 2016. I loved my experience at UBC, studying and modeling biological locomotion from the underground swimming of sandfish lizards in sand to the microscopic motion of a flagellated bacteria in a viscous fluid. During my time at UBC, I attended and presented at an academic conference for the first time of my life.
