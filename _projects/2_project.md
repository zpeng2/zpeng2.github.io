In microrheology, the local rheological properties such as viscoelasticity of a complex fluid are inferred from the free (thermal) or forced motion of probe particles. The probes can be either embedded colloidal particles or
tagged organelles and molecules existing in the biological material. The study of the deformation or flow of biological materials at small length scales has been termed biomicrorheology and deemed a frontier in microrheology. Indeed, particle-tracking microrheology has been widely
used in experimental measurements to characterize the rheological properties inside living cells.
