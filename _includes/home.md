Hello! I am a doctoral student (Fall 2017 - ) at the California Institute of Technology majoring in Chemical Engineering. I am interested in active matter and complex fluids research, especially those at small scales where inertial effects might be negligible.

Before joining Caltech, I was a Master's student at the University of British Columbia where I studied biological locomotion of flexible filaments as a result of fluid-structure interactiion.
