Hello! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Chemical Engineering at the [California Institute of Technology](http://cce.caltech.edu/). My research is focused on the theoretical investigation of [active matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_matter) and [complex fluids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_fluid), especially those at small scales where inertial effects might be negligible. I often use analytical and numerical methods to probe the physics of these systems.
