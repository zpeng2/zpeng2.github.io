Hello! I am a doctoral student (Fall 2017 - ) at the California Institute of Technology majoring in Chemical Engineering. My research is focused on the theoretical investigation of active matter and complex fluids, especially those at small scales where inertial effects might be negligible. I often use analytical and numerical methods to probe the physics of these systems.

Before joining Caltech, I was a Master's student at the University of British Columbia where I studied biological locomotion of flexible filaments as a result of fluid-structure interactiion.
